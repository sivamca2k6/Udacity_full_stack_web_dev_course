# Udacity Nano Degree - Full Stack Web Developer 

## Skills

Python,Flask,PostgresSQL,REST API,Docker

## Overview

The goal of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree program is to equip learners with the unique skills
they need to build database-backed APIs and web applications. 

A graduate of this program will be able to:
• Design and build a database for a software application
• Create and deploy a database-backed web API (Application Programming Interface)
• Secure and manage user authentication and access control for an application backend
• Deploy a Flask-based web application to the cloud using Docker and Kubernetes

This program includes 4 courses and 5 projects. Each project you build will be an opportunity to
apply what you’ve learned in the lessons and demonstrate to potential employers that you have practical
full-stack development skills

## Module 1 - SQL and Data Modeling for the Web
Master relational databases with the power of SQL, and leverage Python to incorporate database logic into your programs.

## Module 2 - API Development and Documentation
Learn how to use APIs to control and manage web applications, including best practices for API testing and documentation.

## Module 3 - Identity Access Management
Implement authentication and authorization in Flask and understand how to design against key security principle. You will also gain experience with role-based control design patterns, securing a REST API, and applying software system risk and compliance principles.

## Module 4 - Server Deployment and Containerization
Develop an understanding of containerized environments, use Docker to share and store containers, and deploy a Docker container to a Kubernetes cluster using AWS


## Project 1 - Design a Venue Booking Database (Completed and Reviewd)
you’ll be building out the data models and database for an artist/venue booking application. The fictitious
startup Fy-yur is building a website that facilitates bookings between artists who can play at venues, and venues who want to book artists.

This site:
• Lets venue managers and artists sign up, fill out their information, and list their availability for shows.
• Lets artists browse venues where they can play, and see what past/upcoming artists have been booked at a venue.
• Lets a venue manager browse artists that would like to play in their city, and see what past/upcoming venues where the artist
 has played/will be playing.

The goal of this project is to build out the data models for this booking application. A prototype design of the web app will be
provided. You’ll use SQLAlchemy and Postgresql to build out the data models upon which this site will rely. You’ll write out both the
raw SQL and SQLAlchemy commands to run for powering the backend functionality of the website
